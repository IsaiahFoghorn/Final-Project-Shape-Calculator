# Java-Shape-Calculator
This program was created in order to meet final project standards. It currently serves to calculate the area and perimeter of flat shapes, but will soon expand to include a number of solids and trigonometric equations. As of yet, this program is only capable of dealing with rectangles, circles, triangles, and regular polygons.
